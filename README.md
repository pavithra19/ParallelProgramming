# ParallelProgramming

This project has tasks and comparison of basic mathematical computations with OpenMP and MPI parallel programming interfaces. Computed and analysed the tasks based on computational power, threads and processes/nodes used. Used EduMPI, Tau and Cube tools to perform the performance analysis of the different algorithms.

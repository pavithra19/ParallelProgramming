# ParallelProgramming

This project has tasks and comparison of basic mathematicatial computations with OpenMP and MPI parallel programming interfaces.
Computed and analysed the tasks based on computational power, threads and processes/nodes used.
Used EdumPI, Tau and Cube tools to perform the performance analaysis of the different algorithms.
